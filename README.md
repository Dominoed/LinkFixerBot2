LinkFixerBot2
=============

An open-source Link Fixer Bot, Version 2.3.1

Why?
----

/u/LinkFixerBot2 was originally inspired by /u/LinkFixerBot.

/u/LinkFixerBot will no longer be running, and the community needed someone to fill the void.

This is where /u/LinkFixerBot2 stepped in.

What?
----

/u/LinkFixerBot2 finds broken links on reddit, such as "r/AskReddit", then the bot fixes the link, to "/r/AskReddit". This is useful for when a user has found a broken link, and is compelled to visit said link. This saves users an extra 10 - 20 seconds, and overall eases the user's Reddit experience.

Who?
----

I am /u/Dominoed. An indie developer/programmer. Feel free to message me with any comments or questions you may have.

When?
----

/u/LinkFixerBot2 was created on July 19, 2013, and runs constantly at least 20 hours a day.

If the bot seems inactive or slow, it is because there aren't many broken links to fix! Even though the bot scans almost every comment made on reddit every second, the bot currently finds a broken link at an average of 3-8 minutes.

How?
----

Well, you're here now. Read the code! ;)
